      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;why-vmfs-on-centos-7&#34;&gt;Why VMFS on CentOS 7?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was running a VMware ESXi server since 4 years. In VMware ESXi the options for local storage are limited, especially when you like redundant storage. The option is to buy a Raid adapter. I decided to move to CentOS with ZFS storage.
Moving the VM’s to a Linux disk can be done by moving all the files to a NFS share, but an another option is to mount the VMFS filesystem. This is not natively available in Linux, but with fuse and vmfs-tools you can make it available. In this article I will describe how I did the installation and movement of the VM’s.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
