      <description>What is the problem with App-V on Windows 10 Anniversary Update Microsoft released App-V as an add-on for Windows in the MDOP (Microsoft Desktop Optimization Pack). So I also run App-V to have some hands on experience with applications on my Windows 8.1 and later Windows 10 installation. Last week I upgraded to Windows 10 Anniversary Update 1607, and I run in to errors with App-V applications. My Total Commander session lost all the configuration settings, slow starting or even not starting App-V applications.</description>

      <description>Why to do test automation with PowerShell? I was involved in a project to implement a new Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) within a large company
To ensure the environment is stable and well-functioning all the time on the same way, I made a script to test the basic functionality of the virtual desktop image. The script also measures the time it takes to complete an action, so this can be used to set a baseline for performance measurement.</description>
