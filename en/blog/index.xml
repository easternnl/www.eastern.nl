      <description>Introduction In this post I will tell you about why and how I build my website. My previous website was already 10 years old and running WordPress. I choose for Hugo now, and made also some CI/CD integrations to get a better end result.
Hugo I was already thinking of building a new site a long time, but it is a big job to do if you want to start from scratch.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On 29th january I visited the VDI Performance Summit which was organized by LoginVSI. Login VSI provides performance insights for virtualized desktop environments such as Citrix XenApp, XenDesktop, Microsoft RDS and VMware Horizon View.
The summit was, of course, organized around the LoginVSI tool. In this blog post I will tell you the 5 quick takes of the conference.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>What is the problem with App-V on Windows 10 Anniversary Update Microsoft released App-V as an add-on for Windows in the MDOP (Microsoft Desktop Optimization Pack). So I also run App-V to have some hands on experience with applications on my Windows 8.1 and later Windows 10 installation. Last week I upgraded to Windows 10 Anniversary Update 1607, and I run in to errors with App-V applications. My Total Commander session lost all the configuration settings, slow starting or even not starting App-V applications.</description>

      <title>Clock application with milliseconds</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The clock application with milliseconds which run always on top! This little tool is build to capture the exact time in case of an performance problem. With an extra tool for video recording it can help to record the screen of the user, and see the probably performance slowness.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;why-to-have-detailed-logon-information-from-citrix&#34;&gt;Why to have detailed logon information from Citrix?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes anyone is asking you, the performance is not what we like. Within a Citrix environment it is easy to get into the director to see the overview of the logon times.
By default Citrix Director gives the following information about the logon:&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Workplace and VDI test automation with PowerShell</title>
      <link>https://www.eastern.nl/en/blog/workplace-and-vdi-test-automation-with-powershell/</link>

      <description>Why to do test automation with PowerShell? I was involved in a project to implement a new Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) within a large company
To ensure the environment is stable and well-functioning all the time on the same way, I made a script to test the basic functionality of the virtual desktop image. The script also measures the time it takes to complete an action, so this can be used to set a baseline for performance measurement.</description>

      <title>Mount VMFS on Centos 7</title>
      <link>https://www.eastern.nl/en/blog/mount-vmfs-centos-7-linux/</link>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;why-vmfs-on-centos-7&#34;&gt;Why VMFS on CentOS 7?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was running a VMware ESXi server since 4 years. In VMware ESXi the options for local storage are limited, especially when you like redundant storage. The option is to buy a Raid adapter. I decided to move to CentOS with ZFS storage.
Moving the VM’s to a Linux disk can be done by moving all the files to a NFS share, but an another option is to mount the VMFS filesystem. This is not natively available in Linux, but with fuse and vmfs-tools you can make it available. In this article I will describe how I did the installation and movement of the VM’s.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
